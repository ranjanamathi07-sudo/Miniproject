## AI-Powered Learning Management System using ML Forecasting

Small description about the project like one below
The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

## About
The AI-Powered Learning Management System for Performance Forecasting and Adaptive Curriculum Personalization is designed to transform traditional digital learning environments by integrating advanced machine learning techniques. In many educational setups, students follow uniform learning paths regardless of their unique strengths, weaknesses, and learning pace. This inconsistency often leads to poor engagement and inaccurate performance assessment.

This project tackles these challenges by incorporating intelligent algorithms that analyze user behavior, predict academic performance, and dynamically personalize the curriculum. Through continuous data-driven insights, the system optimizes learning outcomes while helping educators intervene at the right time.

## Features
- **Machine Learning–Based Performance Forecasting**
Utilizes neural networks and regression models to predict student performance trends.

- **Adaptive Curriculum Personalization**
Recommends tailored learning materials, difficulty levels, and content sequencing based on learner analytics.

- **Scalable Modular Architectur**e
Designed as a framework-based solution to support future expansion and third-party integrations.

- **Real-Time Insights and Visualization Dashboards**
Provides educators with instant metrics on student progress and risk indicators.

- **Efficient Data Handling and Low Latency**
Optimized algorithms ensuring timely model responses with minimal computation overhead.

- **JSON-Based Data Exchange Format**
Ensures structured and consistent communication between backend services and the adaptive engine.
